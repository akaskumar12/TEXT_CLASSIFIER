# 🧠 Machine Learning Classifier Comparison: Logistic Regression, SVM & Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of three fundamental machine learning algorithms for classification:

- ✅ Logistic Regression  
- ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- ✅ Naive Bayes  

The notebook includes end-to-end steps from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation using Python libraries.

## 🧪 Model Overview

| Model               | Description                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Logistic Regression | Linear model for binary/multi-class classification |
| SVM                 | Constructs hyperplanes to separate classes         |
| Naive Bayes         | Probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem        |

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
